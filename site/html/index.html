                    Developing RESTful Web services that seamlessly support 
                    exposing your data in a variety of representations while abstracting
                    away the low-level details of the HTTP protocol is not an easy task
                    without a good framework.  Restbed is an attempt to simplify the development
                    of such systems within the C++ development arena. It offers a clean, portable
                    interface to get RESTful Web Services up and running within a matter of minutes.

Further referred to as "Corvusoft"

"Licensee" refers to the individual or entity that wishes to use the
programs from Emweb bvba. "Library" refers to the most recent version
at the Starting Date of this agreement of the Wt C++ software library
the Licensee wishes to use and library documentation. "License" refers to
Licensee’s right to use the Library under the terms of this agreement.
NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual promises set forth herein, you and we agree as
follows:

Article 1: License
1.1. Emweb grants Licensee a perpetual, non-exclusive, non-transferable limited license for use of
the Library by a group (one or more) of named developers, further referred to as “Developers”, for
the purpose of creation and maintenance of software products. The Developers are listed on the
invoice. The identities of the Developers may only be changed upon notification of Licensee to
Emweb.

1.2. In addition, Emweb warrants Licensee a perpetual, non-exclusive, limited License to
redistribute the Library to third parties in compiled form, for the sole purpose of allowing these third
parties to run the software that was developed by Licensee and linked to the Library, under the
terms of this License. This compiled form of the Library shall be referred to as "Redistributables".
1.3. In consideration for the grant of the license and the use of the Library, Licensee agrees to pay
Emweb the sum of 599.00 Euro (Five hundred ninety nine Euro) per developer, excluding VAT.

Article 2: Restrictions
Licensee shall not modify, copy, duplicate, reproduce, license or sublicense the Library, or transfer
or convey the Library or any right in the Library to anyone else without our prior written consent;
with the sole exception of providing someone else a License as meant under 1.2;
Licensee may not remove or alter any copyright, trademark or other proprietary rights notice
contained in any portion of the Library;
Redistributables, if any, shall be licensed to Licensee's customer "as is";
Applications must be developed using a licensed, registered copy of the Library;
Applications must add primary and substantial functionality to the Library. Applications may not
pass on functionality which in any way makes it possible for others to create software with the
Library without limiting the scope of such software to a restricted application/business domain.
Applications may not compete with the Library;
The Library contains source code of third parties (“Third Party Software”). This code will be clearly
marked as such in the source code (including the original license terms of the third-party software).
Wt Software License Agreement v2.2 Page 1 / 3Licensee agrees to these licenses. In particular, Emweb does not redistribute the ExtJs toolkit. If
Licensee decides to use classes from Library’s Ext namespace, Licensee is obliged to obtain an
appropriate license to download and use a copy of ExtJS, from Ext JS, LLC
(http://www.extjs.com/).

Article 3:Term
The License is granted for an indefinite period of time starting as of the date of acceptance of this
agreement, or the date mentioned on the invoice of the licence fee, should this last date be different
from the date of acceptance of this agreement, hereafter referred to as the “Starting Date”.
Article 4: Library Maintenance
For a period of one year starting as of Starting Date, Emweb shall provide to Licensee Updates,
meaning any new, corrected or enhanced version of the Library as created by Emweb (hereinafter
referred to as “Library Maintenance”), wich may be used under the terms of this agreement. Such
enhancement shall include all modifications to the Library which increase the speed, efficiency or
ease of use of the Library, or add additional capabilities or functionality to the Library. Licensee can
not use Updates released after this period of one year under the terms of this License Agreement
unless extensions to the Library Maintenance are purchased.
Licensee may purchase extensions to the Library Maintenance after the above said period of one
year, at Emweb’s terms and conditions applicable at the time of extension
Article 5: Warranty and Limitation of liability
Emweb licenses the Library to Licensee on an "as is" basis, without warranty of any kind. Emweb
hereby expressly disclaims all warranties or conditions, either express or implied, including, but not
limited to, the implied warranties or conditions of merchantability, non-infringement and fitness for
a particular purpose. Licensee is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using the
Library and assumes all risks associated with the use of it, including but not limited to the risks of
program errors, damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption
of operations.
Emweb shall not be responsible for, and shall not pay any amount of damages, whether direct,
incidental, consequential or other indirect damages, whether based on lost revenue or otherwise,
regardless of whether Emweb was advised of the possibility of such losses in advance. Emweb will
not be liable for the loss of, or damage to, Licensee’s records or data, or any damages claimed by
Licensee based on a third party claim. Licensee shall indemnify Emweb against any and all claims
of third parties with respect to liability as a consequence of the software supplied by Licensee to a
third party and which incorporates Redistributables.
In no event shall Emweb's liability hereunder exceed the amount of license fees paid by Licensee,
regardless of whether Licensee's claim is based on contract, tort, strict liability, product liability or
otherwise.
Licensee is obliged to immediately report any damage to Emweb. For insurance reasons, every
claim must, under penalty of cancellation, be reported to Emweb in writing, at the latest within five
calendar days after occurrence of the incident on which the claim is based.

Article 6: Termination 
6.1. The License may immediately be terminated, in addition to any other remedy, for breach of any
term of this agreement, by written notice of termination to the breaching party.
6.2. Each of the parties may immediately terminate the License, in whole or in part, by written
notice of termination, and without judicial intervention, if with regard to the other party a
Wt Software License Agreement v2.2 Page 2 / 3bankruptcy or other insolvency law petition is filed by or against it or if its undertaking is closed
down.
6.3. The party terminating this agreement under the provisions of this article shall never be liable for
any damages by reason of such termination. Any amounts invoiced by Emweb for the License
before termination of this agreement, shall remain due and payable for the full amount.
6.4. Unless the License has been terminated by Emweb for a reason as provided for in the articles
6.1. and 6.2., the Licensee remains, after termination, entitled to use the Library as it is in use at
termination.
6.5. Articles 2 and 5 of this agreement will continue to apply, even after termination of the Licence,
and will survive the termination of the agreement.

Article 7: Miscellaneous provisions
Payment of license fees owed by Licensee to Emweb pursuant to this agreement shall be paid within
thirty (30) days following the date of invoice by Emweb. In the event that Licensee fails to pay the
licensing fees within this period, interests for late payment shall be due by Licensee and will be
calculated at a rate of 1% per month on the outstanding amounts, without any notice of default
being required. Additionally, in the event that Licensee is delinquent in paying undisputed or
unrightly disputed invoices by more than 60 days from the date of the invoice, Emweb shall be
entitled to charge Licensee, without any notice of default, an indemnity of 15% of the invoice
amount.
Each party warrants that it is authorized to enter into this agreement and that there are no other
agreements which may conflict with this agreement.
Licensee may not assign this agreement without prior written consent of Emweb. Any attempted
assignment or delegation without the required consent shall be void.
Any notice required or permitted to be given hereunder shall be sent by registered mail to the other
party at its address shown above or such other address subsequently notified to the other party for
this purpose.
Any term or provision of this agreement which is held invalid, illegal, or unenforceable for any
reason, shall be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity or unenforceability, without rendering
invalid or unenforceable the remaining terms and provisions of this agreement. Parties shall in that
event commence in good faith negotiations to remedy such invalidity.
This agreement terminates and supersedes all prior understandings or agreements on the subject
matter hereof. Any amendment of this agreement shall only be binding upon the parties when duly
executed in writing by both parties.
Emweb may include Licensee’s company name and logo in a publicly available list of Emweb
customers.
This agreement shall be governed by the laws of Belgium and only the courts of Leuven shall be a
competent jurisdiction.
